# AllHeadPartsAllRacesPatcher

You can enable or disable the patcher including the beast races (Khajiit and Argonians) in the user settings tab.
You can also make all headparts playable or make all headparts genderless as well as disable the all-headparts-all-races option.

This patcher is likely incompatible with any playable child race mod.
There is significant clipping when using the all-headparts-all-races option or genderless headparts.
